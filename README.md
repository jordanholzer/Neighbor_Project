RECOMMENDATIONS

1. There needs to be a renewed focus in increasing the conversion rates from the initial search to the view stage. We are losing over 50% of the traffic from this one step.
    A recommendation would be to look at those searches that come from the search_type = map first since it is the largest bucket and ends with the lowest conversion rate.

2. For another focus area, the business should look to improve their google presence and search results. Specifically, it is the Organic/Google group that we would start with first.
    From the data, I see that this group is strong in converting users to reservations and does not require as much capital to improve.
    The other area that is the largest in initial volume is Paid/Google Ads. We see that we have a decent conversion rate as compared to the other groups but with it being the largest bucket, we are losing the most potential here.

3. The final recommendation would be to get more data about the overall conversion process. Having an overall conversion of ~16% doesn't look to be sustainable over time.
    I would like to see more data on where people fall off in this process and what users experience going from the view to reserving process. If we can improve that process, we have a higher liklihood of converting more users to paying customers.
